title: Devoted and Divided - Women’s Selfless Devotion to Religion
---

### Intro to my Blog!
Hello! My name is Ellie Ames and for my digital project I will be exploring women’s selfless devotion to religion. I chose Ann Lee, Marie D’Oignies, and Ann Lee to analyze as they are all from different periods of time and are all influential Christian women. Each story is unique but explores how women’s selfless devotion to religion is deeply intertwined with gender and manifests itself through physical expressions of faith. I hope you learn something new and enjoy reading!

### Ann Lee (1736-1784)

Ann Lee is the founder of the Shakers, who emerged from a Christian group called the Quakers in 1747. Within her early life, she was married and had had four children who all died early on. This led to her having negative views on sex and caused her to be celibate. Ann Lee later had a vision, “in which it was revealed to her that sexuality had been the causes of the expulsion from Eden and that only be giving up sex could human beings be reconciled to God” (Young p. 405). This reinforced her ideas on celibacy and became a teaching of the Shaker religion. She started to gain a following and had an emphasis on overturning norms and wanted a community of men and women together rather than a community separated by gender roles. Her ideas received some backlash, causing her to be persecuted and for her ideas to be resisted by many. 

```Ann Lee understood her womanhood as an essential part of her ministry as did her followers (Young p. 406)```

Ann Lee had put utmost importance on motherhood and viewed God as mother rather than the typical male depiction of God. She was also called “Mother Ann” and valued shared roles and communal living practices. Ann Lee was illiterate, and therefore used her own personal experiences to create theology and mediate religion. Her being seen as “Mother Ann” plays into the idea that she is a reincarnation of Christ physically. Her followers viewed her as a spiritual mother. Her actions following visions she recieved show how she mediates religion in a material way.

#### Devoted and Divided
Personally, I think that historically and presently women are inherently used to pain. Whether that be from the pains of the menstrual cycle, the physical pain of childbirth, or the societal expectations that come with motherhood. In the case of Ann Lee, losing her children and the pain that came with that seemed to be her reasoning for her negative and shameful views on sex. Her commitment to Christ was extremely important and the visions she saw led to her being celibate and preaching about celibacy. Within the 18th century, women did not commonly hold religious leadership roles. This may be why for some; she was seen as a controversial figure who was rejecting norms. For others, like her followers, this was empowering because she created her own ideas and shared them even though she received backlash, beatings, and ultimately persecution. Rather than succumbing to negative views causing herself to be divided from the mediation of religion, she continued to promote and allow motherhood to be central to the Shaker religion. It is not often that one sees a female depiction of God, but Ann Lee reinforced that idea. Her story is deeply intertwined with gender as the experiences she went through, such as childbirth, motherhood, and breaking free from gender roles, are specifically female experiences. This led to her ensuring that females and males were not divided but rather but had fair opportunities, responsibilities, and leadership positions. She resisted patriarchal pushback but due to her experiences as a female she did not allow that to stop her from gaining a following and leaving her legacy.

### Catherine of Siena (1347-1380)

```“For a woman with substantial literary legacy, Catherine’s own voice and sense of self have largely been overshadowed by hagiographical sources that have shaped her successful cult (Muessig p.1)```

Catherine of Siena was a writer and mystic of the 14th century. She was the last born to a family of 25 siblings with her twin sister who died young. She had started her Catholic religious practices at a young age and joined a female lay movement who were known for dedication to good works in 1369. She gained a following and had a desire for religious reform. She began to follow ascetic practices such as fasting and physical mortifications. She had mystical visions, causing her to be more committed to religious practice. Her followers called her “Mamma” and she gained authority as a talented writer. She identified her own physical sufferings to be like Christ. She was one of the first women to be deemed a doctor of the Catholic Church in 1970.

#### Devoted and Divided 

Catherine of Siena established herself as a prominent religious figure during a time where women did not have to space to do so. Her letters written by the end of her life were sent to many people who were viewed of very highly such as popes and politicians. She was devoted to God regardless of gender expectations causing limited roles for women in religious works. She did extreme physical fasting and caused herself physical suffering. She also claimed to have received the stigmata, which is when one gets wounds of Christ’s crucifixion. This ties into the idea of her faith manifesting itself through physical expression as her physical sufferings allowed her to feel close to Christ and gain a following to whom she could mediate religion to. Her physical letters and writings are tangible expressions of her devotion to God and have allowed her to be respected by men. The sharing of her experience relies on her physical manifestations. These letters can be a representation of authority and devotion during a time where that was not common for women. The quote from earlier shows how even though Catherine herself shared her story in first person, her own voice was lost within male interpretations of her writings. I think this is an example of a gendered experience as male voices overthrew her own voice and cannot encapsulate her female experience. Rather than her sharing her story, it is depicitons of her life through a male lens.

### Marie D'Oignies

```The great love and delight in which she embraced Christ’s cross and tormented her own flesh” (Spearing p. 92)```

Marie D’Oigines was a 13th century beguine. From a young age she was attracted to asceticism and devotion to Catholicism. This was her own choice, as her parents did not push this on her. She was in an arranged marriage at the age of 14. She would punish herself with a rope around her waist and felt inclined to physically hurt herself to feel closer to Christ. She wore a rope under her clothes and would choose prayer rather than sleep. She was not respected in the public and received lots of back-lash for her ascetic ways. She would receive mystical visions and overwhelming feelings from Christ, that would sometimes transfer to the people around her. She renounced all her own possessions and desires. She was celibate, rarely ate, and cut off her own flesh. Her life was made up of spiritual experience and ascetic practices.

#### Devoted and Divided 
Marie D’Oignies story gives insight on the medieval period, in which her religious experience was shaped by the world around her. She claimed to not want to have submission to any men, but I think that her submission to God was quite far. Her being drawn to ascetism and selfless devotion put her outside of traditional female roles of the time. It appears her mystic visions influenced her life and even the people around her and, in that sense, gave her somewhat of religious authority. Through her fasting, physical self-harm, and the clothes she wore, she was able to mediate religion for herself and for others because she could not otherwise due to the male-dominated institution. This represents how intertwined her religion was to physical manifestations to portray it. Her devotion to Christ is very clear and was from an early age all the way up to her death, regardless of her status and position in society and religious institutions. Her lifestyle can be seen as rebellion because those around her almost made a mockery of her and she thus created her own way of mediating religion.

### Conclusion

By looking at each of these women’s early lives, what brought them close to their religion, and the legacies they left, it can be concluded that they all were devoted to their faith in a very powerful way. The selfless devotion of these women correlates to gendered life experiences such as the pains of motherhood, subordination of women, and abilities to make decisions about one’s body. The marginalization of their faith expression each woman endured caused them to have to express their faith physically. Whether that be through using one’s personal experiences to create theology such as Ann Lee, tangible objects like Catherine of Siena, or enduring physical pain and fasting quite like Marie D’Oignies. Although each woman went about their faith differently, all these stories show devotion and lifestyle practices to the extreme, during a time where women were not equally represented in religion. I hope you enjoyed reading about these stories and understood how my analysis developed these points. Thank you!
